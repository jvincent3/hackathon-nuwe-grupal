# Toolkits used:

## React
Awesome JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components whic makes browsing through the web really fast and smooth.

## Chakra UI 
We are using Chakra UI because it's a really simple UI framework which is pretty, modular and really strong on its accessibility.

## React Query
We are using React Query for its flexibility on handling asynchronous queries. And it already has all the functionalities thorougly prepared for the client side.

## Axios
Promised based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

## Formik
Formik is a really good tool for build forms in React and React native. It helps with the moost annoying parts like Getting values in an out of form state. Validation and erro messages

## Yup
Hence we're using Formik, Yup is an awesome mix to validate all the forms we're using with Formik. Yup offers a lot of already made validation functions which saves you the trouble of havin to think for validation algorithms.
